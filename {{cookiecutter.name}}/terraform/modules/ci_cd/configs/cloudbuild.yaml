# This is a Google Cloud Build configuration file in YAML format that describes build configuration
# and steps for a given CI/CD operation.
#
# Everything is set up to run properly in an AIP environment, only actual build steps are needed to
# to put this build configuration into production. Please do not modify the first build step (git
# clone) and do not delete the two git related secrets.

steps:
  # Clone the repository and checkout specified hash
  # XXX: Do not modify the build step below, it is being configured via substitutions
